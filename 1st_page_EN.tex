What do you use on unrooted Android device as a SSH server, that can write to external micro-SD card?
I was happy with SSHDroid, but now it's outdated...

A win32 process A is running.
Process B is attaching to it as a debugger, or opens it using OpenProcess().
ReadProcessMemory() works OK, but fails if it tries to read uncommited memory pages of process A.

The problem: how to force the Windows Memory Manager to commit a page in process A from userland of process B?
I can inject a read instruction into process A, run it, and the page would be committed, but this is not the solution.
